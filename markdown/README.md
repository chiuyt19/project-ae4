### **What data did we use?**
We used Spotify's API to get the data we were interested in.
<br>
### **What Can You Do?**
Our Project allows you to type in your favorite artists and see, by region,
what their most popular songs are. This lets you see firsthand, how connected
the world can be through music. Were your favorite songs popular in countries
you've never been to? Now you can see how similar your tastes are to people
you have never met!
In addition, you can link your favorite playlists, and visualize them!
We incorporated many of Spotify's musical metrics so you can visualize and
understand your musical tastes in depth! Here you can chart your playlists
comparing metrics such as danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness,
liveness, valence, tempo, popularity, or duration!  
<br>
### **Glossary of Terms:**
**Acousticness:** A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
**Danceability:** describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
**Duration_ms:** The duration of the track in milliseconds.
**Energy:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
**Liveness:** Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
**Speechiness:** detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
**Tempo:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
**Valence:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
